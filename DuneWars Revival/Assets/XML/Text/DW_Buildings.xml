		<English>
The hunter-seeker was a deadly tool used by assassins. The tiny floating tadpole-like machine was remotely controlled by an operator situated close by. The device floated through the air, using a tiny Holtzman Field Generator to maneuver. The tip held a camera that transmitted a video signal back to the operator. Vision was distorted by the compressed suspensor field. Once detected, the target was almost guaranteed to be killed. The killing device itself was a tiny needle, tipped with a quick-acting, lethal poison. The needle was retracted until a target is acquired, at which point it appeared, shortly before the device shot into the victim.

		<English>
A Force Shield is a city barrier. A shield was produced by a Holtzman generator, the field deriving from Phase One of the suspensor-nullification effect. Shields can be calibrated to permit the passage of matter below given speeds. This is vital in personal defense shields, as one would suffocate within a shield that did not admit atmospheric gasses. Depending on the shield's setting, the object's speed while passing through the shield would range from six to nine centimeters per second. A shield could also be set to cover either the left or right side of a person if the specific need for it arose. Shields used to protect installations can and usually do have far lower penetration velocities, as life support technologies can be used to recycle atmosphere while the shield is active.

		<English>
A Deathstill was a place where the water of a person's dead body could be reclaimed. On Arrakis, water was the most precious commodity. According to Fremen tradition, a man's water belonged to his tribe. As a result, the Fremen developed deathstills as a way of reclaiming the water of their dead, since it belonged to the tribe, and the dead had no further use of it. The Fremen also put the deathstills to use for reclaiming the water of their enemies. It was usual practice for Fremen women and children to go through a battlefield when fighting was over, killing the wounded soldiers of the enemies with their crysknives, so that their water could be reclaimed in the deathstills. The only way in which someone's water would not be reclaimed by the tribe through the deathstills is they were found guilty of something so heinous that their water was considered tainted.

		<English>
Shai-Hulud is the Fremen term for the sandworm or "Maker" of Arrakis. As with many Fremen terms and words, Shai-Hulud is more than a mere descriptive term for a physical entity. Specifically, it often alludes to the Fremen belief that the sandworm is a physical embodiment of the One God that created and governs the universe. Thus to the Fremen, Shai-Hulud is a sacred term that is usually spoken with a tone of awe, fear or respect. Linguistically, Shai-Hulud has many literal translations, all of which speak of the size, age, and power of the sandworm. Among the noted translations are:

    "Old Man of the Desert"
    "Old Father Eternity"
    "Grandfather of the Desert" 

In Arabic, the name can be split into "Shai" ("thing") and "Hulud" ("eternal" or "eternity"). Shai-Hulud is not to be mistaken with Shaitan, a similar sounding Fremen term that carries a very different meaning.

[TAB]The Bene Gesserit develop their physical abilities as well as their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. Specifically, Prana and Bindu training prepared one for the state of concentration needed to understand the reality of a situation. To gain the proper attitude for complete concentration, one had to first remove oneself, mentally if not physically, from all distractions. To do this one used relaxation techniques which eliminated the distraction from extraneous stimuli. At this point in her studies, the student also learned how to distinguish primary information from secondary or unessential information - "to see the facts and discard the ghafla." Once one has relaxed and had begun to observe the proper information, one had to learn to observe closely and clearly. In this state of observation one assimilated pertinent data from the present situation and recalled all pertinent data from memory without error.
If possible, the observer next assumed a positive physical posture of relaxation and concentration. When the analytical work was being done under private, leisurely conditions, the person relaxed in one of thirty-three postures, each appropriate to a specific type of analytical work. In public situations, the observer assumed an immediate but unobtrusive ritualistic posture which called the muscles and tissues into alertness. If under great stress or immobilized, one could alter this posture to accommodate the restraints. Next, one began controlled breathing for concentration, relaxation, and an oxygen supply sufficient to support accelerated mental activity. Finally, as the last step before entering the concentration mode one withdrew sensory and emotional awareness from all internal areas of distraction. In most cases the adept performed a simple calmness ritual, but in great danger, she recited the Litany Against Fear to subdue any instinctual, primal terror, particularly one stimulated by a race memory fear:
"I must not fear.  Fear is the mind killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain."
At this point, the observer could begin the concentration mode. The concentration mode involved three stages of observational analysis. First, one had to severely limit the attention to only the past and present data concerning the topic. Second, one had to enter a state of total contemplation in which the attention flowed in a steady stream over the topic - the observer completely enclosing the topic. Third, one had to be conscious not of the techniques of observation, not of the presence of self, but of the topic - one had to become the topic. At the moment of unity, the observer understood the topic as she understood herself. Thus, all knowledge depended on the observation of detail and on one's body being trained to support close observation, on objective classification and cataloguing, and on maximum retention of data. Only complete control of nerves and tissues, muscles, blood and chemistry, could detach one enough from the demands of the self to allow objective detachment during the observation, analysis, and synthesis process. The control of the body led to the purification of the mind necessary to separate the real from the unreal.
Although the process of preparation, control, and analysis seemed complicated and time consuming, after one had trained for ten years, first in the separate steps and then in the entire process, one could, if necessary, perform the entire function in less than a second. One of the controls learned is the ability to release oneself from the artificial confines of the human notion of "time." There was no "time" in the concentration mode - all activities could be managed simultaneously.

One of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken. The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant. The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.
A Reverend Mother has access only to her female lineage in Other Memory; her male line is unavailable to her, present as a dark void that terrifies her. Until the time of God Emperor of Dune, the purpose of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme is to breed a Kwisatz Haderach, a male with Other Memory who can see both lines, male and female. Male memory will be complete until moment of conception, when physical contact with the father is lost.
Reverend Mothers may also pass their own ego/memory combination to other Reverend Mothers at will, merely by touching foreheads. When a Reverend Mother dies in the presence of another Reverend Mother, the second will accept the ego/memory of the first to prevent the loss of the dying Reverend Mother's experience and ancestral memories. Especially when the Mother Superior perishes, it is important to take her ego/memory so that her plans and strategies may continue uninterrupted. This is first explored in Dune, when Jessica accepts the life experience of the dying Fremen Reverend Mother Ramallo. In Chapterhouse Dune, Darwi Odrade is Mother Superior, a contentious choice ratified by the fact that she was present at the previous Mother Superior's death, and has her in Other Memory; she represents the most continuous line of leadership. Under extreme conditions, a large community of Bene Gesserit will practice Extremis Progressiva, a mass sharing of ego/memories with each other to spread all the ego/memories amongst everyone; thus, if one survives, they all survive. In Chapterhouse Dune, the Bene Gesserit school on Lampadas, under attack by the Honoured Matres, undertakes Extremis Progressiva; Lucilla escapes with the "Lampadas Horde", hoping to return to the Bene Gesserit with them.

To ensure that the far-flung cities of the empire contributed their expected share of duties and taxes to the government, rulers constructed tribunals to help unify their domains and ensure the law. These local centers of government meted out justice and helped preserve order in the midst of the furthest wilderness.</English>

Shortly after his arrival to Arrakis, Kynes became fascinated by the planet's ecology. Specifically, he began to study moisture on the planet, as well as the relationship the Fremen maintained with the land. The inhospitable Harkonnens suffered his presence since he was there by the Imperial order. During one of his first months, he sent to the Emperor two regular progress reports. Over time, Kynes came to understand the relationship between the sandworms and the spice melange, and the cycle by which spice and sandworms were created. Moreover, Kynes came also to understand the role moisture and water played in this cycle, and how to harness it. Kynes' ideas on reclaiming moisture on Arrakis lead to him developing a plan for the terraforming of the planet, which would eventually see it become a paradise. The strength of Kynes' theories was bolstered by the fact that he accidentally discovered a giant salt pan in the deep desert. This salt pan was evidence that there had once been open water on Arrakis, eons prior.

		<English>
Assembly Plants use a manufacturing process in which parts (usually interchangeable parts) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from work station to work station where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced. By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.

Caladanian wine was considered a vintage of highest quality, grow with great care by the vintners of the near-water world of Caladan. Wine was grown almost in all places on the land surfaces of Caladan, except in the reserved land set aside for Caladan primitives. But special care was taken for the vintage that was raised in the fertile northern lands of the Southern Continent. Much of the vintage was consumed locally, but the majority of it was shipped off world by House Atreides from their spaceport at Atreides Landing.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SARDAUKAR_CONTRACT_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>
The Sardaukar were an elite military force controlled by the Padishah Emperor during the Corrino Empire. They were renowned and feared throughout the Known Universe for their fanatical fighting abilities, and used ruthlessness, cruelty and deceit to accomplish their goals. Members of the Sardaukar were raised from a young age in a ferocious natural environment that saw almost half (6 out of every 13) die before the age of 11. Intense training gave them formidable swordsmanship and espionage abilities, and instilled a religious fervor that added to their mystique. The fighting abilities of the Sardaukar were renowned throughout the Old Imperium. At the apex of their sway over the affairs of the Universe, it was said that their swordsmanship was comparable to that of Ginaz Tenth Level, and their cunning abilities at in-fighting was said to match that of a Bene Gesserit adept. The abilities of the Sardaukar were largely attributed to the harsh environment and brutal discipline they were exposed to on planet Salusa Secundus, the Corrino prison planet. Sardaukar troops typically wore uniforms of grey. Often they wore their hair long, which was taken as a sign of arrogance by those who beheld them. They had a distinct combat style, which allowed them to be recognised easily. When in close-quarter, hand-to-hand combat, if they found themselves surrounded they would group into threes and adopt a fighting stance with their backs to each other. They would carry weapons on their person that would be ingeniously concealed, such as shigawire in their hair or a fake toe or two inserted with small stabbing weapons. Sardaukar were also experts at covert operations, managing to conceal themselves among groups for extended periods of time before striking.

The laws of physics govern how moist air reacts in various temperature conditions. The temperature and moisture concentration at which water vapor begins to condense is called the "dew point." Relative humidity (RH) refers to the amount of moisture contained in a quantity of air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the air could hold at the same temperature. The ability of air to hold water vapor increases as it warms and decreases as it cools. Once air has reached its dew point, the moisture that the air can no longer hold condenses on the first cold surface it encounters.

The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles or CHOAM essentially controls all economic affairs across the cosmos, although it relies upon the Spacing Guild for transport across space due to the Guild's monopoly on faster-than-light travel. CHOAM touched almost all products the Guild will transport, from art forms to technology and of course melange. Many Houses depend on CHOAM profits, and an enormous proportion of those depend on melange. CHOAM directorships were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters. Directorship in the CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under this power.

When she explored the old government mansion at Arrakeen, the Lady Jessica discovered a wet-planet conservatory concealed beyond an airlock, with a palm lock on the oval outer door. This room, about ten meters square, was not part of the building's original construction but had been added to the roof as a bridal present from Tsimpo, one of the early governors of Arrakis, to his fourth wife, Hawtina, who came from the water planet Humidis. Filter glass was used to convert the harsh, white sun of Arrakis into a softer yellow light source. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wetclimate plants, mostly dwarf varieties kept in pots or severely pruned. The plants included mimosa; a flowering quince; dwarf cypresses and cedars; a sondagi, the fern tulip of Tupali; a green-blossomed pleniscenta, grown for its rich fragrance; a green-and white-striped Akarso from Sikun; false orchids; a golden kowhai; flowering fogwood from Ecaz; giant mosses and broad-leaved aspidistras. Above all there were fabulous roses of several varieties, pink, white, blue, variegated. In the center of the room was a small low fountain with fluted lips. Water was distributed among the fern trees and thirsty rubber plants by a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. A more elaborate robotic mulcher and dresser, the design of which was well outside the Butlerian limits, performed automatic gardening routines; it was programmed to remain concealed within the wall when humans were present.
	The function of the wet-planet conservatory as a haven for the homesick wives of governors on a desert planet, as a supremely luxurious enclosed garden of delights, was less important to the Atreides family than its political significance. On a planet where the natives resented date palms for the amount of water they consumed, the idea of a sealed room in which water that could support at least a thousand persons was wasted on exotic plants was anathema. The conservatory was known to the Fremen as the "weirding room", fit only for witches, and it is recorded that the head housekeeper of the mansion, the Shadout Mapes, regarded the room with loathing. The conspicuous waste of water was a deliberate status symbol, a statement of the power and wealth of the Imperial government.

The plants included mimosa; a flowering quince; dwarf cypresses and cedars; a sondagi, the fern tulip of Tupali; a green-blossomed pleniscenta, grown for its rich fragrance; a green-and white-striped Akarso from Sikun; false orchids; a golden kowhai; flowering fogwood from Ecaz; giant mosses and broad-leaved aspidistras. Above all there were fabulous roses of several varieties, pink, white, blue, variegated. In the center of the room was a small low fountain with fluted lips. Water was distributed among the fern trees and thirsty rubber plants by a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms.

On a planet where the natives resented date palms for the amount of water they consumed, the idea of a sealed room in which water that could support at least a thousand persons was wasted on exotic plants was anathema. The conservatory was known to the Fremen as the "weirding room", fit only for witches, and it is recorded that the head housekeeper of the mansion, the Shadout Mapes, regarded the room with loathing.

When she explored the old government mansion at Arrakeen, the Lady Jessica discovered a wet-planet conservatory concealed beyond an airlock, with a palm lock on the oval outer door. This room, about ten meters square, was not part of the building's original construction but had been added to the roof as a bridal present from Tsimpo, one of the early governors of Arrakis, to his fourth wife, Hawtina, who came from the water planet Humidis. Filter glass was used to convert the harsh, white sun of Arrakis into a softer yellow light source. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wetclimate plants, mostly dwarf varieties kept in pots or severely pruned. The plants included mimosa; a flowering quince; dwarf cypresses and cedars; a sondagi, the fern tulip of Tupali; a green-blossomed pleniscenta, grown for its rich fragrance; a green-and white-striped Akarso from Sikun; false orchids; a golden kowhai; flowering fogwood from Ecaz; giant mosses and broad-leaved aspidistras.

A Force Shield is a city barrier. A shield was produced by a Holtzman generator, the field deriving from Phase One of the suspensor-nullification effect. Shields can be calibrated to permit the passage of matter below given speeds. This is vital in personal defense shields, as one would suffocate within a shield that did not admit atmospheric gasses. Depending on the shield's setting, the object's speed while passing through the shield would range from six to nine centimeters per second. A shield could also be set to cover either the left or right side of a person if the specific need for it arose. Shields used to protect installations can and usually do have far lower penetration velocities, as life support technologies can be used to recycle atmosphere while the shield is active.

Project Amal was an early attempt by the Bene Tleilax to create synthetic melange in order to eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. Upon presenting their idea to the Padishah Emperor Elrood Corrino IX, in 10,154 A.G. the Tleilaxu were granted the right to occupy the planet Ix by force (with the help of Elrood's Sardaukar army) and remade it into a laboratory station for the project. The old Emperor wanted to remove the spice monopoly by making sure that he had the only access to it, thus controlling the Spacing Guild. The Tleilaxu subsequently renamed Ix "Xuttuh" after their founder. In the year 10,156 A.G., Elrood IX was assassinated by Count Hasimir Fenring at the behest of the Crown Prince Shaddam. Shaddam, once under the title of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, gave Fenring the title of Imperial Spice Minister and ordered him to supervise the project.
Although Tleilaxu Master Hidar Fen Ajidica managed to create an artificial melange (called "ajidamal," or "amal") that seemed to have the original's properties, it did not work properly. Test-sandtrout exploded when exposed to it, and Fenring's test of its use by Guild Navigators ended in catastrophe as one heighliner and its passengers were destroyed and the Navigator of a second heighliner died. When Duke Leto Atreides invaded Xuttuh in 10,175 A.G. and reestablished Prince Rhombur of House Vernius as ruler of Ix, all the records of Project Amal were destroyed by Fenring. When news reached the Landsraad, Shaddam denied all participation, claiming never to have heard of the project. He maintained that it had probably been something his senile father Elrood had done in his last days. The Tleilaxu Masters involved were executed. Ajidica himself died from the side effects of ajidamal: his body literally fell apart as the synthetic melange had eaten it away from the inside out.

Project Amal was an early attempt by the Bene Tleilax to create synthetic melange in order to eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. Upon presenting their idea to the Padishah Emperor Elrood Corrino IX, in 10,154 A.G. the Tleilaxu were granted the right to occupy the planet Ix by force (with the help of Elrood's Sardaukar army) and remade it into a laboratory station for the project. The old Emperor wanted to remove the spice monopoly by making sure that he had the only access to it, thus controlling the Spacing Guild. The Tleilaxu subsequently renamed Ix "Xuttuh" after their founder. In the year 10,156 A.G., Elrood IX was assassinated by Count Hasimir Fenring at the behest of the Crown Prince Shaddam. Shaddam, once under the title of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, gave Fenring the title of Imperial Spice Minister and ordered him to supervise the project.

		<English>The Missionaria Protectiva was the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood's "black arm of superstition", responsible for sowing the seeds of superstition in primitive cultures, so that the Sisterhood could take advantage of them when those seeds grew to full-fledged legends. They were responsible for spreading the Panoplia Propheticus (myths, prophecies, and superstitions). This "religious engineering" spread "infectious superstitions on primitive worlds, thus opening those regions to exploitation by the Bene Gesserit." Panoplia Prophetica provide the opportunity for a Bene Gesserit to later cast herself as a guide, protector, or some other figure in fulfillment of a prophecy in order to manipulate the religious subjects for protection or other purposes. These myths also exploit religion as a powerful force in human society; by controlling the particulars of religion, the Bene Gesserit have a manipulative lever on society in general. The Bene Gesserit also employ the Missionaria Protectiva to prepare the Empire for the arrival of the Kwisatz Haderach.</English>
